# SMART BIOMETRIC HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM

## Capstone Title:
"SMART PORTABLE HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM WITH EMAIL ALERTS FOR INSTANT HEALTH RESPONSE.”"

## Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a smart biometric heart rate sensor system developed as a capstone project. The system is designed to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry, and it sends instant email alerts for health surveillance. It uses a MAX30102 sensor module, an Arduino Uno R3 board, an OLED LCD display, a buzzer, an LED, and an ESP-01 ESP8266 WiFi module. The system was developed by a group of students from ICCT Colleges Foundation, Inc as part of their capstone project.

To achieve this, we will use the Arduino Uno R3 Board as the microcontroller, the OLED LCD 0.91″ inch or 1.3″ inch I2C LED Display for visual feedback, a Buzzer for auditory alerts, and an LED for visual alerts. The ESP-01 ESP8266 WiFi Module will be utilized to connect to the API server, which will handle the email notifications. This system will provide real-time heart rate monitoring and alerts, enhancing the user's ability to track their health and well-being.
