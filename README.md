# SMART BIOMETRIC HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM 

## Capstone Title:
"SMART PORTABLE HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM WITH EMAIL AND SMS ALERTS FOR INSTANT HEALTH RESPONSE."

## Description:
Welcome to the repository for our capstone project, the Smart Portable Heart Rate Sensor System. This cutting-edge solution is designed to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry in real-time, providing users with vital health information on-the-go. Utilizing advanced biometric sensor technology, including the MAX30102 Heart Rate and Pulse Oximeter Sensor Module, our system ensures accurate and reliable data collection.

### Key Features:
- Real-time monitoring of heart rate and pulse oximetry.
- Email and SMS alerts for instant health response.
