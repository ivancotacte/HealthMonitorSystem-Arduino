# SMART BIOMETRIC HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM

## Capstone Title:
"SMART PORTABLE HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM WITH EMAIL AND SMS ALERTS FOR INSTANT HEALTH RESPONSE."

## Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Smart Portable Heart Rate Sensor System developed as a capstone project. The Smart Portable Heart Rate Sensor System with Email and SMS Alerts for Instant Health Response is a cutting-edge solution designed to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry in real-time, providing users with vital health information on-the-go. Utilizing advanced biometric sensor technology, including the MAX30102 Heart Rate and Pulse Oximeter Sensor Module, this system ensures accurate and reliable data collection.

The system integrates seamlessly with an Arduino Uno R3 Board and a 0.91-inch OLED display for clear and concise visual feedback. Additionally, auditory alerts are provided through a buzzer, while a LED offers visual notifications for immediate attention.

Furthermore, with the inclusion of the ESP-01 ESP8266 WiFi Module, this system can transmit data to a NodeJS API, enabling remote monitoring and analysis. This feature enhances user accessibility and allows for prompt intervention in case of abnormal readings.

To enhance versatility, the system incorporates a Load Sensor 50kg along with the Load Cell Amplifier HX711, facilitating additional health monitoring capabilities such as weight measurement.

Overall, this Smart Portable Heart Rate Sensor System offers a comprehensive solution for proactive health management, empowering users with actionable insights and prompt alerts for timely intervention.
