# HealthMonitorSystem

## Capstone Title:
"SMART BIOMETRIC HEART RATE SENSOR SYSTEM WITH INSTANT EMAIL ALERTS FOR AUGMENT HEALTH SURVEILLANCE."

## Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for a smart biometric heart rate sensor system developed as a capstone project. The system is designed to monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry, and it sends instant email alerts for health surveillance. It uses a MAX30102 sensor module, an Arduino Uno R3 board, an OLED LCD display, a buzzer, an LED, and an ESP-01 ESP8266 WiFi module. The system was developed by a group of students from ICCT Colleges Foundation, Inc as part of their capstone project.
